# Real-Time Chat Application

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Built with React](https://img.shields.io/badge/framework-React-blue.svg)](https://reactjs.org)
[![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Prototype-yellow.svg)]()

A polished, real-time chat application that recreates core features of modern team chat tools (rooms, presence, and instant messaging). Built with React and minimal dependencies so it’s easy to extend and deploy.

Notes:
- Replace the files in `./assets/` with your actual screenshots (PNG or JPG).
- Prefer 1280×720 or similar for hero, 800×450 for other screenshots. Compress images for faster load.

## Features

- User identity via simple username (extensible to OAuth)
- Create, join, and share chat rooms with unique IDs/links
- Real-time messages within rooms (compatible with WebSocket/Socket.IO backends)
- System notifications for user join/leave events
- Clean and responsive UI with accessible components
- Easy to extend: add file sharing, typing indicators, message history, etc.

---

## Tech Stack

- React (functional components + hooks)
- Plain CSS (or CSS modules / styled-components if preferred)
- Socket or real-time backend (Socket.IO, WebSocket, or Firebase / Supabase)
- (Optional) Node.js + Express for a lightweight signaling/backend server

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kamaleshkamalesh2005/Chat_Application.git
   cd Chat_Application
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

If your app requires a backend (Socket.IO or other), run it on a separate port and configure the client endpoint in environment variables (see `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`).

---

## Usage

- Enter a display name to join the app.
- Create a new room or paste a room link/ID to join an existing conversation.
- Share the room URL to invite others — new participants will see system notifications.

---

## Development

- Keep components small and focused. Create a `components/` folder for reusable UI pieces.
- Centralize real-time connection logic (e.g., a `services/socket.js`) so the app can switch backends easily.
- Add tests with Jest + React Testing Library for UI and integration behavior.

Recommended branches:
- main: stable releases
- develop: active feature integration
- feature/*: individual features or bugfixes
